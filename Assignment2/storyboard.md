</p>

Sebastien - I was trying to just show how I want everything to be conntected and have as many user choices be available on each page as possible. 

### Ainsleigh:

</p>

Sebastien - Ainsleigh modeled the website a little more than I did but I like what she did. Her sketch looks good and lays out a good baseline for what the site should look like.

### Ryan:

</p>

Sebastien - Ryan also mapped out the layout of the website and I like the way he showed the flow from top to bottom.

## Crazy Eights

</p>

Sebastien - I just gave examples of what I wanted each site to look like with very basic detail and descriptions. 

### Ainsleigh:

</p>

Sebastien -  I liked the way Ainsleigh made each of her slides look. I like the visual element. 

### Ryan:

</p>

Sebastien - Ryan took a different approach which I appreciate. He focused on design features that he wants to include.
