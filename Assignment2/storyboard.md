</p>

Sebastien - I was trying to just show how I want everything to be conntected and have as many user choices be available on each page as possible. 

Ryan - I like the circular flow of this mindmap, which points to the map as being the center of the design.

### Ainsleigh:

</p>

Sebastien - Ainsleigh modeled the website a little more than I did but I like what she did. Her sketch looks good and lays out a good baseline for what the site should look like.

Ryan = This presented a great start to the design process for the final site. Ainsleigh was able to present more design-centered elements that will ensure that our final site looks good and will present an effective user experience.

### Ryan:

</p>

Sebastien - Ryan also mapped out the layout of the website and I like the way he showed the flow from top to bottom.

Ryan - I was mostly focusing on incorporating narrative elements into our site, so that it is not overwhelemed by data and can instead tell a complete story.

## Crazy Eights

</p>

Sebastien - I just gave examples of what I wanted each site to look like with very basic detail and descriptions. 

Ryan - These ideas present the essentials of what our project will need to successully present our data and findings.

### Ainsleigh:

</p>

Sebastien -  I liked the way Ainsleigh made each of her slides look. I like the visual element.

Ryan - One thing I really like about this design is the idea for horizontal scrolling across our site. I think it presents an opportunity to make our project more unique and useful to the user.

### Ryan:

</p>

Sebastien - Ryan took a different approach which I appreciate. He focused on design features that he wants to include.  

Ryan - My main focus was to come up with some ideas that would make our site stand out and also present the user with a more unique and enriching experience.
